# AUDIO-PROCESSING-USING-PYTHON
Audio processing project using Python, Jupyter and Anaconda


Audio signals are signals that vibrate in the audible frequency range. When someone talks, it generates air pressure signals; the ear takes in these air pressure differences and communicates with the brain. That's how the brain helps a person recognize that the signal is speech and understand what someone is saying.

Audio signal processing is a subfield of signal processing that is concerned with the electronic manipulation of audio signals. Audio signals are electronic representations of sound wavesâ€”longitudinal waves which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions.

Anaconda is an open-source distribution for python and R. It is used for data science, machine learning, deep learning, etc. Anaconda offers the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on a single machine.

The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.

The main idea of this project is to build an audio processing software where we can manipulate audio signals however we like, We first started by collecting different data and codes then using whatvere worked to finally make it work.
